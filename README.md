# Guild: Basic Pluggable Javascript Datastore

Guild is a simple pluggable javascript datastore. It should work  with SQL, Redis, LocalForage
and HTTP interfaces.

Declare object schema, find data, use the data in your frontend or over and api.

Especially handy when you want to push data from an API to the front end and use the same
data models in the back end and front end. Agnostic as to your front end library (angular or whatever)
